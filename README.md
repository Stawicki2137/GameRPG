# 🧙‍♂️ RPG Game – OOP Design Patterns in C#

This project is a console-based RPG game developed in C# as part of my **Object-Oriented Design** course. It focuses on implementing core gameplay mechanics using well-known **design patterns**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice clean object-oriented design
- Use appropriate design patterns to manage complexity, portability, and maintainability
- Ensure the codebase is **easy to extend** with new features
- Build a playable RPG-style maze game


## 🛠️ Implemented Design Patterns

| Pattern                  | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decorator**            | To apply temporary effects that boost player attributes (e.g. holding a Lucky Sword increases Luck) |
| **Builder**              | For generating the maze, items, and enemies                            |
| **Singleton**            | For managing and presenting the game state                             |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | To handle keyboard inputs and delegate actions                       |
| **Observer**             | To track and apply time-based effects after drinking elixirs           |
| **Visitor**              | For combat logic when interacting with enemies   

## 🧪 Project Status
This project is still under active development — new features and improvements are planned for future updates.

## 🚀 Coming Soon
